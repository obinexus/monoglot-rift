# Automaton Module

This module provides the core state-transition model that powers the regex engine.
It is designed to be independent of specific regex syntax and can be reused for
other state machine applications.

## Components:
- State management and transitions
- Automaton construction and traversal
- DFA minimization and optimization
- State equivalence analysis
